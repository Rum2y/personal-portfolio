            I am a passionate and driven individual with four years of academic
            experience in Petroleum Engineering, complemented by three years of
            self-taught programming. My journey into coding began out of
            curiosity, and it has since become an essential part of my skill
            set. Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in frontend
            web development, working with technologies like React, JavaScript,
            and Tailwind CSS, while also applying my technical knowledge to
            engineering projects. I am eager to merge my expertise in petroleum
            engineering with my programming skills to solve real-world
            challenges and drive innovation in both industries.
